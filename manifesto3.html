        <p>this is the pesto manifesto: an improvised recipe of sorts </p>

        <p>when making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind: </p>
        
        <p class="left"> 1. must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce. <br>
            2. must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbor’s garden. <br>
            3. must use pine nuts. <br>
            4. no food processing allowed. </p>

        <p>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves to be made RIGHT. Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity! or should it? </p>

        <p class="left"> 1. become inspired by mediocre productions. <br>
            2. don’t covert production and experimentation recipe <br>
            3. always leave the edges rough, so that someone can cut themselves <br>
            4. a photoshop’d joke is DEEP and MEANINGFUL <br>
            5. take the knife to cultural icons and produce: produce the produce for the recipe and destroy the recipe <br>
            6. follow and muddy up every else’s recipe; pun and play, annihilate and resurrect MEANING </p>

        <p> keep in mind: </p>

        <p> pesto is delicious when it’s made FRESH. </p>
